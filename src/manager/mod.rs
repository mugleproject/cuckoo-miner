//! Cuckoo-miner's manager manages the loading, unloading, and querying
//! of mining plugins installed on the system. It is meant as a helper
//! to users of cuckoo-miner, to allow quick enumeration of all mining plugins,
//! and return information about whether a particular plugin can be run
//! on the host system.
//!
//! Although a plugin can only return its name and description at the moment,
//! it will be extended in future to allow for other information such as
//! version, and whether it can be run on a particular system.
